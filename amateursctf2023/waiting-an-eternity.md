We are given a URL: [`https://waiting-an-eternity.amt.rs/`](https://waiting-an-eternity.amt.rs/)

Upon going into it, we observe that one of the response headers is the `Refresh` header:
```
Refresh: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000; url=/secret-site?secretcode=5770011ff65738feaf0c1d009caffb035651bb8a7e16799a433a301c0756003a
```

So this means that after 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 we will go to [`https://waiting-an-eternity.amt.rs/secret-site?secretcode=5770011ff65738feaf0c1d009caffb035651bb8a7e16799a433a301c0756003a`](https://waiting-an-eternity.amt.rs/secret-site?secretcode=5770011ff65738feaf0c1d009caffb035651bb8a7e16799a433a301c0756003a)

It tells us: `welcome. please wait another eternity.` In the Response headers, we notice that it has the `Set-Cookie` header, and sets the cookie to `time=1689406769.1374853`. I tried overwriting that by running this in the console:
```js
document.cookie = 'time=0'
```

upon reloading it told me I had to wait another 1689406934.2992535 seconds. So it does some subtraction to figure out how much time we need to wait. So I tried to reach infinity by setting the time to:

```js
document.cookie = 'time=9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999'

And it was given the flag: `amateursCTF{im_g0iNg_2_s13Ep_foR_a_looo0ooO0oOooooOng_t1M3}`
